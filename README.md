## Usage

```yaml
name: Preview Links in Linear
# Run action when a new comment is added to a pull request (as we are expecting a Linear-bot comment with a link to the Linear issue)
on: [issue_comment, deployment_status]

jobs:
    preview-links-in-linear:
        # Ensures the action only runs on pull requests and not issues
        if: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request }}
        name: Preview Links in Linear
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - name: Attach preview link to Linear issue
              uses: madsnedergaard/preview-link-in-linear@main
              with:
                  provider: vercel # or netlify, cloudflare, github-deployments
                  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  LINEAR_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LINEAR_API_KEY }}
```

## How it works

1. The action is triggered when a new comment is added to a pull request (as we are expecting a Linear-bot comment with a link to the Linear issue)
2. It finds GitHub deployments on the pull request's branch
3. It finds the Linear issue associated with the pull request from the comment
4. It attaches the preview link to the Linear issue 🪄

### Supported providers

The following providers have been tested and verified to work:

- Vercel
- Netlify
- Cloudflare
- Fly
- Any custom setup that uses GitHub Deployments

For other providers, you can use the `github-deployments` provider and set up tooling to create a deployment status on a pull request.

Need something else? Feel free to open an issue or make a PR to add support for it.

## Getting started

TBD - the first one here is a crude PoC using API tokens instead of OAuth.

## Roadmap

- Support multiple GitHub deployments for the same PR
- Switch to using OAuth for authentication with Linear
- Publish the action to the GitHub Marketplace
